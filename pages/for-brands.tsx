        question4="How will I receive orders?"

        answer1="It takes less than two minutes to get set up on Pedlar. We seamlessly integrate your Shopify store into our platform using a Shopify app."
        answer2="No. Once we have integrated your Shopify store with Pedlar, all inventory management is done automatically in real-time through APIs."
        answer3="All product information including prices, images and inventory levels are updated automatically on Pedlar. This means when changes are made on your Shopify store it is reflected on Pedlar in real time."
        answer4="You receive orders as soon as they are made and they will appear as normal on your Shopify store. All Pedlar orders are tagged from Pedlar so you'll know its an order from us."
        answer5="You (the brand) ships the order using your normal order fulfilment process. Pedlar is committed to adhering to your shipping and returns policy so it's business as usual for you. If Pedlar chooses to subsidise shipping and returns, Pedlar will absorb that cost."
